                           especially within the sports industry. My work ranges from CRM administration 
                           and dashboard development to creating innovative scoring models that help 
                           drive smarter decision-making and elevate fan experiences.

                           My background includes a Master’s in Information Science from Indiana University,

                           and valuable real-world experience through roles with organizations like 
                           Pacers Sports & Entertainment. Whether it's Salesforce, SQL, Tableau, or Python, 
                           I’m always eager to build, explore, and apply tools that transform raw data into impactful insights.

                           Above all, I’m committed to continuous growth. Every challenge is an opportunity 
                           to learn something new, expand my perspective, and make a bigger impact. 
                           Whether it’s diving deeper into data science, optimizing CRM ecosystems, 
                           or leading collaborative projects, I’m always seeking ways to grow both personally and professionally.

                                       My work involves building and maintaining dashboards that provide actionable insights on ticket sales,

                                       I supported the data team by transforming and cleaning raw data 
                                       from various sources to ensure smooth integration into the organization’s 
                                       data infrastructure. I developed several dashboards and reporting tools, 
                                       including a social media performance dashboard used across digital departments, 
                                       and survey analysis platforms for part-time staff and game-day events. 
                                       I also worked on merging legacy e-commerce data into the current system, 
                                       helping improve continuity and analytics across platforms. 
                                       This role sharpened my technical skills and taught me how to deliver clear, 
                                       actionable insights to diverse teams within a fast-paced sports environment.
