I developed several dashboards and reporting tools, including a social media performance dashboard used across digital departments, and survey analysis platforms for part-time staff and game-day events. I also worked on merging legacy e-commerce data into the current system, helping improve continuity and analytics across platforms. This role sharpened my technical skills and taught me how to deliver clear, actionable insights to diverse teams within a fast-paced sports environment.
