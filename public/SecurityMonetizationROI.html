    <h1>Security ROI & Optimization</h1>
    <h2>Operational Analysis by Jack Doehrman</h2>
    <p>
      This analysis evaluated the return on investment for enhanced security systems by quantifying time savings, staffing reductions, and revenue impact across event operations.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- Replace with summary of what the project tackled -->
        The goal was to understand whether modernizing security checkpoints could offset labor costs and improve the guest experience without compromising throughput or safety.

    <section class="section" id="data">
      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wait time logs at various gates</li>
        <li>Event attendance and gate entry timestamps</li>
        <li>Hourly staffing schedules and labor costs</li>
        <li>Security vendor pricing and upgrade options</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="section" id="analysis">
      <h2>Analysis Approach</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- Insert your approach here -->
        Modeled per-event throughput using pre- and post-upgrade data. Compared time savings and headcount reductions across gates. Built a cost-benefit model to project breakeven over 3 seasons.

      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- Plug in major insights or quantified impacts -->
        Upgraded equipment reduced average wait times by 40%, allowing staffing cuts of ~15% while maintaining gate flow. ROI realized within 18 months through labor and guest satisfaction improvements.

    <section class="section" id="visuals">
      <h2>Visuals & Outputs</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- Embed visualizations, charts, or dashboard links -->
        Comparative wait time charts, gate heatmaps, and breakeven scenario models were created using Tableau and Excel.
