    <h1>Season Ticket Member - "At-Risk" Scoring</h1>
    <h2>Predictive Modeling Project by Jack Doehrman</h2>
    <p>
      This project was designed to identify season ticket members (STMs) at risk of not renewing their memberships using historical STM behavior, CRM activity, and engagement data.
    </p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section class="section" id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The "At-Risk" scoring model started with a concept of attributing points to an account in CRM based on the Member's interactions with the team and their service representative.
        These actions are meant to show the value of a membership, and can interacting more with the team in these ways can significantly increase the Member's likeliness to renew.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="data">
      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CRM activity logs (Salesforce)</li>
        <li>Ticket scans and attendance</li>
        <li>Historical renewal behavior</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="methodology">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
         Using historical Member attendance data, I was able to discover the correlation between the Member tiers, the average attended games each year by tier, and the average renewal rate of that tier.
      </br>
          I learned that our Veteran Members (5+ years tenured) were able to reach an 80%+ renewal rate no matter how many games they attended, but on average, attended about 9 of the 18 regular season matches.
          Our Established Members (1-4 years tenured) were able to reach an 80% renewal rate by attending 12 of the 18 matches.
          Our Newcomer Members (first-year members) achieved an 80% renewal rate by attending 15 out of 18 matches.
      </br>
          These groupings allowed us to set a goal for each Member tier.
      <ul>
        <li>Veterans: 120 Points</li>
        <li>Established: 160 Points</li>
        <li>Newcomers: 180 Points</li>
      </ul>
        And Members would earn points through their interactions with the Team and their Service Representative, based on how important we saw the activity towards their value perception of the Membership.
        <ul>
            <li>Attending games: 10 Points per Match</li>
            <li>Attending gameday Fan Experiences: 5 Points per Experience</li>
            <li>Attending non-gameday Member Events: 5 Points per Event</li>
            <li>Receiving a free Seat Upgrade: 3 Points per Match</li>
            <li>Having a conversation with their service representative: 3 Points if at a match / 1 Point if a call/email</li>
        </ul>
        Finally, I created a Score Prediction Model that calculated the Member's current total score, the total days since they renewed for the current season, and the total days until the new renewal period.
        This was the final product that each Service Representative was able to view. The reason a rep could only see if someone was "On Pace" or "At Risk" was a simplistic approach to grouping all Members rather than needing to keep tabs on what tier they are and the score goal for that tier.
      </p>

    <section class="section" id="impact">
      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Accounts flagged "at risk" were able to be segmented and targeted for outreach through targeted campaigns and events. Once the renewal period arrived, our Member Services team had a clear list of Members who may have needed more convincing to renew.
